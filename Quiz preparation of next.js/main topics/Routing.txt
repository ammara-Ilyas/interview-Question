                  Group route

Route groups are useful for:

Organizing routes into groups e.g. by site section, intent, or team.
Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment

Opting specific segments into a layout
Organize routes without affecting the URL path
Creating multiple root layouts
        
                Dynamic route
1  Dynamic Segments are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.

2  Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time.

3 If content is fetched within the generateStaticParams function using a fetch request, the requests are automatically memoized.So it pass to multiple request by  generateStaticParams, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.

/////////////////catch all catch
The difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (/shop in the example above).

Features that rely on useEffect (e.g logging page views) and useState (e.g a per-page feedback form).
To change the default framework behavior. For example, Suspense Boundaries inside layouts only show the fallback the first time the Layout is loaded and not when switching pages. For templates, the fallback is shown on each navigation.
