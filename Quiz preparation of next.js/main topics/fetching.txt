Whether the data is cached or not will depend on whether the route segment is statically or dynamically rendered. If the segment is static (default), the output of the request will be cached and revalidated as part of the route segment. If the segment is dynamic, the output of the request will not be cached and will be re-fetched on every request when the segment is rendered.
