3 Streaming in SSR and its lamitation
First, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.
The server then renders the HTML for the page.
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.
A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.
Finally, React hydrates the user interface to make it interactive.

4 Streaming helps in three ways:
Faster page loading: Reduces the time it takes for the page to start loading (Time To First Byte).
Faster content display: Reduces the time it takes for the page to display its main content (First Contentful Paint).
Faster interaction: Reduces the time it takes for the page to become interactive, especially on slower devices (Time to Interactive).
