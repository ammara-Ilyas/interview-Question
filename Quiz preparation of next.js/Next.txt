Server-side Rendering (SSR): Generates HTML on each request, providing faster initial load times and better SEO.
Example: User dashboards, real-time data applications.

 Generates HTML at build time and reuses it on each request. Suitable for pages with content that doesn't change frequently.

API Routes: Enables creating API endpoints inside the application.
Image Optimization: Built-in support for optimizing images.
Fast Refresh: Improved hot reloading for faster development.
Middleware in Next.js 14 allows you to run code before a request is completed. It's used for tasks like authentication, logging, redirects, and handling rewrites.

File-based Routing: Pages are created by adding files to the pages directory.
