What is JSX?

What is the Virtual DOM in React?

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM.
Explain the concept of components in React.

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface.
What are React props?

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React.
What is the state in React?

The state is a built-in object in React components that is used to keep track of the component's data and trigger re-rendering when the data changes.
What is the difference between state and props in React?

Props are passed from parent to child components, and they are immutable. State is managed within a component and can be changed.
Explain the component lifecycle in React.

The component lifecycle consists of three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Each phase has specific lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
What are React hooks?

React hooks are functions that enable the use of state and lifecycle features in functional components. Examples include useState for managing state and useEffect for handling side effects.
What is the purpose of the useEffect hook?

useEffect is used for performing side effects in functional components. It allows you to manage lifecycle events, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
What is the purpose of the useState hook?

The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function that allows you to update the state.
Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components in React.

Controlled components are those whose state is controlled by React, while uncontrolled components have their state managed by the DOM itself.
What is React Router, and how does it work?

React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It provides a declarative way to define routes and navigate between different views.
What is the significance of keys in React lists?

Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in a React list. They help React efficiently update the DOM by recognizing which items have changed, been added, or been removed.
